# Commander Crash

My first attempt at entering JS13K, and my first serious attempt at using JavaScript to make a game. 
It's no wonder I couldn't finish it.

"Building" requires a working installation of GCC. Why? Because I did something weird to separate my code into
readable units: Used the C Preprocessor. So if you're wondering why there are C/C++ includes, defines and guards 
in the files, there you have it.
